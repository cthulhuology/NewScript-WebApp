<h4>Wed Apr 22 2009 - New NewScript Compiler</h4>
<h5>- Dave Goehrig</h5>
<p>I've added a number of major changes today to the beta code.  Most significantly, the environment is now properly compiling multiple objects in the dictionary to an intel native binary object format.  For the time being the code is limited to 1 page (4096 bytes) of executeable code, but that is sufficient for testing purposes.  I'm personally less interested in producing applications at this point as proving out the code.
</p>
<p>Today's changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New registration code w/ default icon selection bar</li>
<li>Improved color-higlighting of objects and verbs</li>
<li>Firth compiler now compiles the full lexicon</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few known bugs that haven't been fixed yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to define an object or verb with a space in its name, which can not be executed due to how the NewScript object parser parses strings</li>
<li>Some people are still registering without user icons, making their channel icons invisible</li>
<li>A few opcodes are generating incorrect x86 assembler OR are not evaluating the same way in the emulator</li>
</ul>
<p>Some changes that are in development that haven't been pushed live:
<ul>
<li>Javascript color highlighting code</li>
<li>NewScript -&gt; Javascript bridge code, call Javascript from NewScript</li>
<li>NewScript emulator object redefinition support</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reason these changes haven't been pushed live was that I've been running into errors where builtin Javascript objects have properties which can not be inspected without triggering permissions errors.  This isparticularly true of HTTPRequest objects, which blow up with wonderfully cryptic error messages in different browsers.
