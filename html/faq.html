<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Why?</dt>
<dd>Because software today is too complex, too stuck in 1968, too hard to learn, and too easy to get wrong.  I wanted to create a tool to teach kids how to program from Buffalo to Bangalore.  This is that tool.</dd>
<dt>Who?</dt>
<dd>NewScript is for everyone.  The primary purpose of the NewScript environment is to make programming accessible.  It is my intention to evolve the language to more closely resemble how people without a degree in computer science  would want to talk to a computer.</dd>
<dt>How?</dt>
<dd>Software doesn't need to be complicated.  Microprocessors only do so many things.  NewScript seeks to address this problem by distilling the essence of <a href="http://www.ultratechnology.com/forth.htm">Thoughtful Programming</a>, and marrying it with the reality most kids face today.  As most kids don't have control over what software comes installed on their machine, we have to make use of what they do have: a web browser.</dd>
<dt>What?</dt>
<dd>The NewScript is a tri-stack virtual machine:
<ul><li>Data Stack</li><li>Continuation Stack</li><li>Context Stack</li></ul>
The Data Stack stores intermediate values that get consumed and produced by executing various slots in the objects found on the Context Stack (aka Lexicon).  Flow control is managed through both direct and indirect manipulation of the Continutation Stack (aka Return Stack) which references the addresses of routines to execute in the future.  Most traditional programming languages confuse these concepts into a single stack, and as a result render certain forms of programming nigh impossible.
</dd>
<dt>When?</dt>
<dd>Soon.  The fully operation Version 1.0 release of the NewScript environment will be made Summer of 2009.
