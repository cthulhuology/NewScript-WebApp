<h4>NewScript Opcodes</h4>
<p>The NewScript virtual machine is a dual stack virtual machine with an object oriented lexicon.  The following functions are defined in the core word set, and are available at all times:</p>
<dl>
<dt>.</dt><dd>returns from the current slot</dd>
<dt>nip</dt><dd>drops the nos</dd>
<dt>,</dt><dd>drops tos</dd>
<dt>;</dt><dd>pushes tos to the return stack</dd>
<dt>dup</dt><dd>dupicates tos</dd>
<dt>over</dt><dd>copies nos to the tos</dd>
<dt>^</dt><dd>pops the top of the return stack to tos</dd>
<dt>++</dt><dd>increments the value at the address in tos</dd>
<dt>--</dt><dd>decrements the value at the address in tos</dd>
<dt>-</dt><dd>negates tos</dd>
<dt>+</dt><dd>add nos to tos, and drop nos</dd>
<dt>*</dt><dd>multiply tos by nos, high 32 bits in nos</dd>
<dt>/</dt><dd>divide nos by tos, remainder in nos</dd>
<dt>*/</dt><dd>mutiply top of data stack by the ratio nos / tos, remainder in nos</dd>
<dt>~</dt><dd>binary compliment tos</dd>

<dt>@%</dt><dd>fetch address in dst register</dd>
<dt>&lt;</dt><dd>set tos = 1 if nos is less than tos, else 0</dd>
<dt>=</dt><dd>set tos = 1 if nos equals tos, else 0</dd>

<dt>-&gt;</dt><dd>copy up cnt register bytes from src to dst</dd>

<h4>NewScript Objects</h4>
<p>NewScript objects consist of a collection of verbs and their definitions.</p>
<img src="Definition.png">
<p>Each object defines a context, in which the verbs have their particular meanings.  Unlike most other object orient languages, NewScript objects have no traditional constructors, classes, inheritence, or prototypes.  Rather, NewScript objects are conceptually "contextual dictionaries", that allow for a wide variety of programming styles.
</p>
<p>The NewScript conceptual model looks at objects as proper nouns, and are capitalized by convention.  Each object knows how to perform one or more "verbs" which are the equivalent of functions or subroutines in other languages.  The object's verbs are invoked using the "subject verb" syntax as in English:</p>
<img src="SubjectVerb.png">
<p>In the above example, the code will push the number 4 onto the stack, then the Math object's "square" verb is invoked.  The result is that the tos register will contain the number 16.  Each of the values are color coded to account for their usage in the language:
</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="black">Object</font></li>
<li><font color="green">verb</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">number</font></li>
<li><font color="red">undefined</font></li>
<p>A programmer can quickly identify code that contains undefined terms by looking for red text.  Any verb that has not been defined for the current context will appear as <font color="red">red</font> text in the object listing.  As soon as the programmer types a word that has been defined it turns blue, green, or black depending on its type.</p>
<h4>NewScript Classes</h4>
<p>In NewScript, the notion of "class" is largely an informal definition.  When we speak of the "class" of an object what we mean is that the object understands a set of verbs.  A formal definition of class in this sense would be:
</p>
<dl><dt>class</dt><dd>the set of all objects that implement a particular set of verbs</dd></dl>
<p>For example, we could say that all objects that implement the methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>x</li>
<li>y</li>
<li>height</li>
<li>width</li>
</ul>
<p>Are members of the <b>Rectangle</b> class, and can be treated as if they conceptually defined a bounding box in a Cartesian space.  Typical implementations of objects like Images, Cubes, Windows, Icons, and Widgets could all be said to be Rectangles, as they would likely implement the above set of methods.
