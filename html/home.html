<p>NewScript is a new kind of programming language and environment. </p> 
<p>It is a web-based, persistent, shared, graphical, interactive, cooperative, editor, debugger, emulator, and compiler.</p>
<p>NewScript is also a programming language, that is object-oriented, uses postfix notation, is contextual, and requires highly factored code.</p>
<p>The development environment runs in your web browser, and can even compile processor native applications using only your browser!</p>
<p>This means that any code that you and others develop in NewScript can be built without any special software, no compiler, no server side process, just your browser.</p>
<p>More than just being 'object oriented', NewScript stores all bundles of code in objects that are stored in 'channels' similar to pages on a social networking site, or an IRC chat room.
</p>
<p>As more than one user can be on a channel at any one time, more than one user can edit the code on that channel at any time, allowing for teams of programmers to work simultaneously on a project, while communicating through channel chat.
</p>
<p>The NewScript environment is also persistent, and automatically saves every revision of every object to the server.  The full history of your code is available at all times!</p>
<p>In addition to a Intel IA32 native compiler, the NewScript environment includes a NewScript Virutal Machine emulator, so that you can walk through and evaluate your code as soon as you write it.</p>
<p>The NewScript Virtual Machine currently supports Intel IA32, and will soon also support Atmel AVR32, PowerPC, MIPS (Playstation2), and ARM7 microprocessors.<p>
<p>In addition to the NewScript language, the editor also has native support for Javascript, and the full environment can be inspected, edited, and run within the NewScript environment itself!</p>
<p>Future development will also include a Javascript -&gt; NewScript translator and a set of OS native binary interfaces, that will allow users who know Javascript to compile their programs into platform native binaries as well.</p>
